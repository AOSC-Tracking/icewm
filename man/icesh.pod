=head1 NAME

 icesh - control properties of windows

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<icesh> [I<OPTIONS>] I<ACTIONS>

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<icesh> provides commands for use by shell scripts that query or
affect a window's state. B<icesh> also supports commands for
querying and controlling the L<icewm(1)> window manager.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<icesh> recognizes the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

A command option specifies the window or windows to which subsequent
arguments apply. If no command option is given, but an argument
does require a window then a selection crossbar is invoked to select
the desired window interactively. Some arguments do not require this.

=over

=item B<-w>, B<-window> I<WINDOW_ID>

Specifies the identifier of the window, I<WINDOW_ID>, for which the
action applies.  Special identifiers are B<root> for the root window
and B<focus> for the currently focused window.

=item B<-c>, B<-class> I<WM_CLASS>

Specifies the window manager class, I<WM_CLASS>, for which the action
applies.  If I<WM_CLASS> contains a period, only windows with exactly
the same I<WM_CLASS> property are matched.  If there is no period,
windows of the same class and windows of the same instance (aka. I<-name>)
are selected.

=item B<-r>, B<-root>

Is equivalent to B<-window> B<root>.

=item B<-f>, B<-focus>

Is equivalent to B<-window> B<focus>.

=item B<-a>, B<-all>

Selects all clients of the window manager.

=item B<-s>, B<-shown>

Selects all currently mapped clients of the window manager.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-d>, B<-display> I<DISPLAY>

Specifies the X11 DISPLAY.  If unspecified, defaults to B<$DISPLAY>.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a brief usage statement to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print the program version to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Print copying permissions to F<stdout> for the program and exit.

=head1 USAGE

The purpose of B<icesh> is to provide commands that can be used from a
shell script (see L<sh(1)>) to affect the state, geometry and hints
associated with a window, or to list and parse information about
existing windows.

It should be noted that B<icesh> works on any window manager that is
compliant with the GNOME WinWM/WMH specification.  Some commands, like
C<setTrayOption> and the actions, however, are IceWM specific.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Lists all workspace names:

    icesh listWorkspaces

Example output:

    workspace #0: `main'
    workspace #1: `web'
    workspace #2: `doc'
    workspace #3: `dev'

Close terminal work.

    icesh -c work.XTerm close

Activate terminal fun.

    icesh -c fun.XTerm activate

Print opacity for all xterms.

    icesh -c xterm.XTerm opacity

Change opacity for all xterms.

    icesh -c xterm.XTerm opacity 84

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are examined by B<icesh>:

=over

=item B<DISPLAY>

The display to use if the B<-display> option is unspecified.

=back

=head1 COMPLIANCE

While B<icesh> is largely compliant with the GNOME WinWM/WMH
specification, it only minimally supports NetWM/EWMH.

B<icesh> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report bugs
for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues>.
