=head1 NAME

 icewm-theme - icewm theme configuration file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

F<> F<$ICEWM_PRIVCFG/theme>
 F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm/theme>
 F<$HOME/.icewm/theme>
 F</usr/share/icewm/theme>
 F</usr/local/share/icewm/theme>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains the name of the default theme.  On startup B<icewm>
reads this file to obtain the theme name, unless B<icewm> was started
with the B<--theme> option.  Whenever a different theme is selected from
the B<icewm> Menu then the theme file is overwritten with the name of
the selected theme.  This theme file contains the keyword C<Theme>,
followed by an equals sign, followed by a double-quoted string with the
theme name.  The theme name is the name of the theme directory, followed
by a slash, followed by the theme file.  Usually the theme file is just
F<default.theme>, but a theme may have alternatives.  Alternatives are
small tweaks of a theme.  These are specified in their own F<.theme>
file, which replaces F<default.theme>.  If no theme file exists then
B<icewm> will use the default setting of
C<Theme="default/default.theme">.
