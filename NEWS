git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 1.4.2...1.5.0

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (716):
      Add class YArrayIterator for easy iteratation over YArrays.
      Move definition of null to ref.cc to make clang-analyze happy.

      prevent a leak on nstr in unescape.
      make scrollGC not static but local.
      Reduce clutter and clarify.
      Make tabPos not unsigned but int to prevent warnings, in multilineAlloc.

        for genpref.
      Simplify rd_str and prevent a corruption on bad input.
      Free theme_preferences when done.
      container->addSorted may refuse to add an item its name is a duplicate.
        Detect this and free the item to prevent a leak (3x).
      Prevent a memory leak.
      When executing a child program check if it can be found alongside the
        absolute path of icewm-session. Also fix the examination of exit status
        of icewm and the detection of crashes.
      Also print a string option if it has only just a description, but not a
        non-null value.
      Adding a menu item may fail. If this happens then the items must be freed
        to prevent a leak.
      Fix the calculation in the comment for DECIMAL_DIGIT_COUNT. Base max on
        less than. Add inrange. Add GetArgument. Fix an off-by-one error in
        intersection and reduce it to a one-liner.
      Replace the taskBarBg global, which was initialed everywhere, by the
        function getTaskBarBg(). Properly free data on when taskbar is done.
        Sanitize taskBarAtTop (clang-analyze).
      Add two options to control the max tray icon dimensions.
      Add some handy operators for struct timeval. Add support for clock_gettime
        and prefer it over gettimeofday. Use monotonic clocks for interval
        measurements. Simplify timer management. Simplify
        YApplication::mainLoop. When HOME is undefined get its value from
        getpwuid.
      Cleanup battery code. Free all resources. No globals.
      Add two new options to control applet dimensions: TaskBarGraphHeight,
        TaskBarGraphWidth. Free resources when done. No globals. Fix

        to prevent warnings. Remove obsolete CONFIG_ANTIALIASING code.
      timers for mainLoop.
      Check if directories are searchable.
      Add 3 more focus models. freeActions() when done. Hide globals behind a
        function. Restart icewm from same executable location. Don't initialize

        free it.
      free when done.
      remove unused code.
      Don't init a upath with NULL, but use null.

        in reading order left-right-top-to-bottom.
      Implement UserTime in a separate class with an extra seconds field.
      Fix getNetWMStrutPartial. Initialize property data pointer before testing
        if it is non-null.
      We no longer need ypixbuf.cc ypixbuf.h yimage.cc.
      No longer include ypixbuf.h.
      Remove globals.
      initialize prop before using it.
      Rewrite icewmbg to support unique colors and images per workspace.
        Backgrounds are periodically checked for changes on filesystem when
        switching workspace. New option for one large full multi-head monitor
        background. Can now also scale an image to fully cover a single monitor.
        Suppors all configuration options also from the command line.
      Remove the ifdef CONFIG_GUIEVENTS around "extern YWMApp* wmapp", so that
        it is always available.
      Add some ifdefs/ifndefs to support different configure --enable/--disable
        option combinations.
      Changes for ALTLinux which has its own prototypes for strlcpy/strlcat.
        Also cleanup obsolete AC_FUNC_*s and sort -u the CHECK_FUNCs. Add two
        AC_RUN_IFELSE to detect correct operations of strlcpy/strcat. Define
        HAVE_STRLCPY / HAVE_STRLCAT if they do. Don't include our own
        strlcpy/strlcat if these are defined.
      Better fix for HAVE_STRLCPY/HAVE_STRLCAT.
      Also mention HAVE_STRLCPY and HAVE_STRLCAT. Remove obsolete and duplicate
        defines. Define defines always with a true numeric value of 1.
      Prefer AC_DEFINE/AH_TEMPLATE over AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED. This gives an #undef
        instead of a #define to 0, which is what we want.
      Manual pages in AsciiDoc.
      Generate manpages and html files from AsciiDoc.
      ASCIIMAN and ASCIIMAN_FORMAT variables for generating manpages from

      Explicitly control which themes are installed.
      Update links to online docs.
      Fix URL formatting.
      Move ypaths.h out of yapp.h, because a pure-yapps may not need X11.
        Include ypaths.h into some C++ files which do need it.
      Have --help and --version exit not with 1, but with 0.
      Make icewm-session resilient against a missing icewmtray. Add a --notray
        option to not start icewmtray. See issue
        https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/154.
      Make icewm-session much smaller in size by not linking any X11, image or
        font library. ylibrary.cc and ylibrary.h are obsolete. Reduce
        AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT programs.
      icewm-session --notray.
      Change Menu Help into a submenu with 3 items for all manual pages.
      Redesign/rewrite icesound. Try all enabled sound drivers until one works,
        from ESD, ALSA, OSS, but the order can be specified. Drop support for
        YIFF. Fix support for ALSA. Make class YCommandLine obsolete. Make
        verbose more usefully verbose. Add -O and -A options. Also check in
        ~/.config/icewm/sounds/ for audio files. Identify which GUI events are
        not implemented yet.
      drop YIFF.
      GUI_EVENT_NAMES were not used (prevent a warning).
      include strings.h for strcasecmp.
      Update build for new icesound.
      More sounds info. Add keys example.
      Move obsolete source to attic.

        https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/87.
      mstring additions to reduce memory allocations.
      Three fixes for correctly drawing taskbarbg.xpm when it is a Gradient. See
        issue https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/87.
      include strings.h for strcasecmp. Make History::get() return a const
        char*.
      Remove superfluous GUI_EVENT_NAMES to prevent a warning.
      mstring additions to reduce very-short-lived memory allocations.
      Redesign/rewrite icesound. Try all enabled sound drivers until one works,
        from AO, ESD, ALSA, OSS, but the order can be specified. Drop support
        for YIFF. Add support for libAO. Fix support for ALSA. Make class
        YCommandLine obsolete. Make verbose more usefully verbose. Add -O and -A
        options. Also check in ~/.config/icewm/sounds/ for audio files. Replace
        the busy-wait polling with a blocking select. Identify which GUI events
        are not implemented yet. Update CMake, autoconf/automake and manpage.
      Move obsolete sources to attic (ycmdline, yimage, ylibrary, ypixbuf).
      Update CMake build for icesound with libAO.
      icesound manpage and html.
      More icesound support.
      Changes for debug build.
      Updates for upcoming release.
      Make distcheck work again by removing obsolete sources src/ycmdline.cc

      Add new AsciiDoc manpages icesound.1.adoc icewm.1.adoc icewmbg.1.adoc.
      ASCIIMAN variables for adoc to manpage conversion.
      Generate .1 manpages from AsciiDoc.
      CMake support for generating manpages from AsciiDoc.
      Add icesound.
      Make icewm-session much smaller by not linking any X11/font/image libs.
      CMake much smaller icewm-session by not linking any X11/font/image libs.
      Redirect the help message output to stdout.
      Make --help output go to stdout and exit success.
      AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT is no longer needed to make distcheck
        succesful.
      Move obsolete sources to attic and have make distcheck OK!
      Don't initialize a ref with NULL, but use null.
      Don't initialize a ref with NULL, but use null. Free fBrighter and fDarker
        when YColor is done. Prevent copying YColor. Fix indentation of
        Graphics::drawSurface. Cleanup and simplify.
      Enforce that a ref cannot be initialized with a NULL or, but require a
        null.
      Update NanoBlue to version 1.2 by SolisX.
      +ledclock, +collapse.xpm, +expand.xpm.
      Only apply TimeFormat hack when it is still equal to '%X'. See issue #159.
      Docked iterator simplifies 8 loops.
      When ledPixSpace is 1 pixel wide then replicate it 5 times per space.
      Use tlog for MSG reports.
      Start icesound before icewm so it can catch the geStartup event.
      Let tlog also report milliseconds.
      When signalling GUI events: The first event must be geStartup, Ignore all
        other events before that. Because there is no event buffering, when
        multiple events occur in a burst, only signal the first event of the
        burst. See issue #159.
      Also support geDialogClosed and geDialogOpened GUI events. Don't generate
        a geWindowLower GUI event when the window is minimized, otherwise
        geWindowMin will be overwritten and missed by icesound. See issue #159.
      Also support geDialogClosed and geDialogOpened GUI events.
      If sound could not be played then don't ignore next event. Add -z ad -l
        options. Support geDialogOpened and geDialogClosed. Report which audio
        interface is used if verbose.
      Update for -z, -l.
      Better explain how to add a toolbar button. See issue #163.
      install _mandir/man1/*
      Fix AO for single channel sound files. Add --play to easily test sounds.
      New OSS requires sndfile and sys/soundcard.h.
      Add proper support for the OSS audio interface.
      Fully support OSS.
      cmake for the new OSS.
      Let icewm-session close unwanted file descriptors on startup without
        making any disturbing noise. See issue #165.
      Close OSS device when done.
      Update for icesound --play and list of sounds (dialogs).
      Better fix for ledPixSpace being only 1 pixel wide.
      Add root() to xapp to easily get the X Root window.
      Make doWMAction static so we can use it elsewhere without a manager.
      Make the icewm -r, --restart flag restart the running icewm.
      Document new behavior of the -r, --restart option.
      enable translations for registerProtocols.
      Inline zerotime. Remove coarse timers (too coarse).
      rename ignore_enternotify_hack to EnterNotifySerial and put in class
        YWindow.
      undo inadvertent DEBUG define
      Add the word "Manual" to the title to more easily differentiate it from
        manpages.
      Give each help page its own resource class name.
      No need for XSync when this is implicit in a subsequent function call.
      Remove 2 superfluous XSyncs.
      Before exec or exit XFlush suffices.
      use False instead of 0.
      Support HTML special double quotes.
      XQueryTree may fail, so ensure winClients is properly initialized.
      clarify setBorder configureRequest.
      Move fd-leak-patch.txt to contrib/.
      Move OS2 files to contrib/.
      NO_CONFIGURE only applies to preferences options. Other options like
        --notify must still work when NO_CONFIGURE is defined.
      Fix ifndef/define WMACTION_H.
      Ensure X11/keysym.h is included in icehelp.
      Ensure X11/Xutil.h is included in wmclient.h
      Remove include "config.h" from yarray.h (must be included in .cc).
      Remove Atoms which are: not used and defined in X11/Xatom.h.
      Remove unused occupyMenu and maximizeMenu.
      Remove unused _XA_WM_CLIENT_MACHINE and _XA_NET_WM_OPACITY.
      LogoutCommand should not affect the menu entries for Shutdown and Reboot.
        See issue #167.
      Merge branch 'icewm-1-4-BRANCH' of github.com:bbidulock/icewm into
        icewm-1-4-BRANCH
      Remove old debug warning.
      Revert "Added sane c_str shortcut". Because is a naieve mistake. If it
        were possible than class cstring is superfluous.
      automake 1.13.4 still works fine
      Eliminate duplicate code, cleanup and simplify.
      Be more explicit about test results. Some extra newlines for readability.
      No lazy or static needed for initialization of mailbox app.
      boolstr.
      class YAtom.
      Changes to tray. Solutions for bug #152.
      When including both yarray.h and mstring.h then include mstring before
        yarray.
      Memory leak fix and improvements for YRefArray. Derive YStringArray from
        YArray instead of YBaseArray. Add new class MStringArray for efficient
        array for mstrings.
      New tests for MStringArray and YRefArray. Add class stringcounted.
      Fix compilation for g++-4.8 for issue #152.
      include math.h because it uses round(3).
      Replace fmax/fmin by max/min as this is all integers, not FP.
      free rootProxy.
      free fTasks and fWindowTray.
      free workspaceItem[].
      construct YObjectArray with a defined capacity.
      remove erroneous csmart array index operator to fix compile error.
      More tags. Less warnings. Support website links to local absolute paths.
        More html special chars. Better error message translations.
      Fix a use-after-free error (valgrind) for destroyed tray icon windows.
        Support system tray orientation (and visual, but is now commented out).
        Support system tray notification messages. Reduce the number of
        superfluous tray relayouts a little bit.
      keep expiry timer running (if nonempty).
      add type symmetry for mstring plus operator.
      Add some convenient options and a much more detailed help message.
      Fix a memory leak. Add support for showing workspace names also when
        PagerShowPreview is on.
      Make pagerShowNumbers default false so that workspace names are shown in
        PagerShowPreview mode.
      swap.
      swap two elements in an array. findRemove.
      Manipulate tasks in the task pane more like the tabs in a web browser.
        Improved interaction and feel. Use left mouse button instead of third.
        Use Alt+Button2 to close a task. See issues #172.
      Document task button behaviors.
      document workspaces scroll wheel.
      XDG base dir spec: "If, when attempting to write a file, the destination
        directory is non-existant an attempt should be made to create it with
        permission 0700."
      add TOC. fix email
      Split readDesktopNames in smaller functions and also limit count by
        workspaceCount. Only set _WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES if GNOME1_HINTS. Only set
        _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES if WMSPEC_HINTS. Fix for setting _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES
        where XmbTextListToTextProperty always failed for style
        XUTF8StringStyle.
      Create ~/.icewm/ with mode 0755.
      Incorporate two remarks: 1. Use a smart pointer to reduce boilerplate in
        readDesktopNames. 2. Restore XmbTextListToTextProperty in
        setNetDesktopNames, but now use a better return code checking, to fix
        the setting of _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES.
      fix a memory leak for YRect in updateLayout.
      Prevent creating a hole with undefined data if array insert is beyond the
        current count.
      Prefer private themes over system ones. Als have checked theme menu items
        if a theme alternative is used (non-default.theme). Expand tabs.
      reuse memory in setMwmHints.
      Increase sprintf buffer size.
      link Xlib.
      make it compile.
      make it compile
      make it compile.
      remove superfluous includes
      Replace pointer based *YAction with value based YAction.
      Revert erroneous commit d3b00cc4ed07f4f55695b9b91b20e0e9b08d9cf7 "JDK7
        focus fix" as this makes IceWM focus behavior non-conformant. See issue
        #23.
      Correction for seconds interval not being milliseconds.
      Taskbar never needs focus and should never get focus as focus must reside
        with applications. See issue #23.
      Inheritance from YAction is not needed.
      remove 2 unused actions.
      no need to activate the taskbar.
      avoid RevertToNone when setting focus. use RevertToPointerRoot.
      Turn predefined actions into an enumerated type. This allows to
        switch-case on them and saves a little space.
      workspaces Shift + left button click
      should have class
      Prevent disturbing flashing when switching focus.
      use CopyFromParent by default as this prevents disturbing flashing on
        frame borders when switching focus.
      prevent disturbing flashing on miniicons
      prefer CopyFromParent if possible.
      Better initialization of YDesktop window.
      When printing X errors use tlog instead of warn so we get the time in ms.
      Don't layout resize indicators when window is fullscreen, because then
        window widths/heights will be zero, which causes X errors.
      When an unmap event is due to a destroy and we have the DestroyNotify then
        set the wfDestroyed flag. This will prevent some operations which are
        invalid for destroyed windows and only cause X errors.
      SaveSet only applies to adopted clients, not to icewm internal windows.
        Only call XRemoveFromSaveSet and XAddToSaveSet if the frame is adopted.
        This saves needless operations which only result in X errors. When a
        window is destroyed then prevent it from being focused. Check the return
        value of XGetWindowAttributes as this may fail if window was destroyed.
        Fix a swapped parameter order for XSelectInput.
      Don't attempt to resize destroyed windows as this is needless and only
        causes X errors.
      It has no use to call setColormap when XColormapEvent is a
        ColormapUninstalled, but it can lead to X errors.
      Ignore stray closing form tags. Increase margins. Support WM protocols.
      Change ToolTipDelay from 1000 to 500. (1000 is really tedious).
      Two convenience functions for easier starting/disabling timers.
      Split class YToolTip into a timer and a window. Only create the window
        when needed. This saves about 25% of windows created (depends on theme).
      Only set tooltip text once, not twice.
      add CONFIG_RENDER to print_configured.
      Set tooltips on taskbar collapse button.
      prevent a SEGV crash in announceWorkArea when restarting from a nonzero
        workspace.
      add titles to taskbar for helpful "xwininfo -tree" output.
      convert from YCursor to Cursor.
      Only create titlebar buttons and resize pointer windows when it is
        apparent that they are really required. This prevents superfluous
        internal windows which were never used. Move titlebar buttons from
        wmframe.cc to wmtitle.cc. Improve sensitivity of resize handles at top
        side of title bar. Only create MiniIcon when it is going to be needed.
      option -j#JOBS
      add support for _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS.
      Move brittle inline frame list manipulations into robust dedicated list
        class.
      prevent illegal window layer.
      fix call to dumpZorder for 2nd arg.
      fix includes
      also include ytimer.h.
      better fix for include is ymenu.h.
      add options. -t runs tests on combinations of configure options.
      free about dialog labels.
      shrink, swap.
      add support for _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT.
      test _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT.
      Use YList class to keep track of sibling windows.
      support _NET_WM_PING.
      corrections for _PING.
      perf _NET_CLIENT_LIST is done: only update on stacking changes.
      flags and style can be unsigned.
      Keep track of frame extents and only update if changed.
      Keep track of WM_STATE and WIN_STATE property values and only update them
        when they have changed.
      also track WM_STATE details.
      TrayApps were not freed when restarting, causing ylist preconditions to
        fail. Replacing inline list with YObjectArray corrects that and gets rid
        of list boilerplate. Use of a smart private timer simplifies timer
        management.
      track 3 more properties.
      Slightly more accurate use of fSavedWinState in setWinStateHint reduces
        superfluous property updates a bit more.
      Set background for tray icons in issue #188.
      _NET_WM_PING timeout also looks fir PID/HOST in group leader.
      Revert "Set background for tray icons in issue #188."
      Set taskbar background. This then also becomes a default background for
        tray icons in issue #188 while not hindering background pixmaps.
      add last missing applet titles.
      Make icewm tray internal by default. This is much more reliable (and
        cheaper) than an external icewmtray process.
      Weed out obsolete ifdefs and configure options.
      Add option TaskBarEnableSystemTray.  Fix internal/external YXTray
        parameter.
      Fix 3 bugs in YVec.

      hide first, then focusLastWindow
      typo
      focusLastWindow must not attempt to set focus to taskbar or nothing will
        have focus and a focusless system results without any keyboard control.
        This can be tested by using the AddressBar and then hit Escape. See
        issue #186.
      getLastFocus must not return taskBar, because taskBar never was focused
        and trying to give it focus results in other usable apps not getting
        focus, with an unfocused system in sloppy mode. In setFocus make sure
        that always focus has been set to something, otherwise we get the
        situation none of the global hotkeys work. This solves both issues #185
        and #186.

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (161):
      Fix for 'msgstr' not being a valid C format string, unlike 'msgid'.
      Fix for /proc/stat not being opened with FD_CLOEXEC flag. This would cause
        IceWM to generate warnings whenever it fork+execs a child program.
      Fix for properly closing open fd on error.
      Fix for properly closing open fd on error.
      Fix for not leaving stdin closed.
      Fix for properly closing dup-ed socket.
      Fix for properly closing open fd on error.
      Fix for properly dup2/close devnull.
      Fix for preventing lots of spurious warning messages for MappingNotify
        events.
      Fix to replace msg with MSG to keep IceWM silent when not debugging.
      Two strstr calls for "AC" and "BAT" had the parameters reversed: fixed.
        strcat3 could be changed from 12 lines to 1: fixed.
      Reading of /proc and /sys files simplified and made more robust.
        Previously the frequency of only one CPU core was examined. Now all
        frequencies of the first 8 CPU cores are examined. In the CPU tooltip
        give the maximum and minimum CPU core frequency. Also give the
        temperatures with one decimal. Fix temperature formatting bug for C.
      Merge branch 'icewm-1-3-BRANCH' into tooltip-details
      Implement the top of the TODO list: add support for --help and --version
        options to each executable.
      remove obsolete pragmas (interface + implementation).
      small changes to make BUILD_TESTS work (except for icebar)
      precondition simplification
      tTempBuf is not needed and not desirable
      precondition simplification
      mstring cleanup to make it more readable and more easily verifiable
        correct.
      much more elaborate test suite for mstring.
      bug fix for missing sizeof(data_t) in YString::set(...)
      Assignment operators should return a reference, not a copy.  Prevent
        calling data() when length() is zero as this may access a NULL fStr
        causing a crash.
      Make mstring::split use indexOf, which is shorter and more correct (avoids
        dereferencing null strings).
      Icehelp didn't draw the html list entries. Fixed processing of node::li
        nodes by calling draw() to draw <LI> entries. There were several
        mismatches of new/delete/malloc/free: fixed. Freed memory was accessed
        in handleClose(): fixed. In YIcon::findIcon(int)  newstr was called for
        a temporary string which was never going to be freed anywhere: fixed by
        using pstring instead of newstr.
      Leak fix: objects should be a YObjectArray otherwise clear() will not be
        called.
      Leak fix in findThemes: npath was used where dpath was meant. configArg
        wasn't used.
      Leak fix in YWMApp::actionPerformed and in meain.
      leak fix in WindowOptions::setWinOption for op->icon.
      No slash needed when terminating an 'url' tag (3x).
      upath::parent and upath::name were not implemented. upath::slash prevents
        temporaries. cstring::operator const char *() simplifies code. Several
        fixes to relative()/child(). A few minor new methods and operators.
        +upath tests.
      no need for misc.$(OBJEXT) when libice.la is already given.
      Goodbye SGML here is AsciiDoc. The doc/*.sgml files replaced by
        doc/icewm.adoc. Autoconf and cmake updated.
      rename with .md extension
      markdownify
      renamed to INSTALL-cmakebuild.md
      update for cmakebuild and asciidoc.
      parse the AsciiDoc output.
      remove the problematic dependency on glob_pattern_p by writing our own
        internal version.
      remove non-portable dependency on asprintf.
      Remove non-portable dependency on asprintf.  Remove stray backslashes.
        Rewrite while loops as for loops.  Replace calloc+strcpy with strdup.
      Remove HAVE_ASPRINTF from YInputLine::complete as globit_best no longer
        uses asprintf.
      Prevent warnings when compiling with: make CXX="g++ -std=c++98 -pedantic
        -Wall".
      +strlcpy, strlcat, read_file, read_fd, tlog.
      mstring + upath improvements.
      Properly handle keyboard events by scrollbars.
      Make icehelp feature complete.
      add TOC, link to X startup. Remove LibPath (no longer used).
      remove duplicate references to sources which are also in
        ${ICE_COMMON_SRCS}.
      HAVE_ASPRINTF doesn't imply _GNU_SOURCE. Remove both.
      Make globit.c 7-bit ASCII.
      include config.h (needed for CMake).
      add load_text_file, check for EINTR when reading, use O_TEXT in read_file.
      Cleanup option parsing: be more strict in what is accepted as option
        value, don't abort parsing on error, but skip the offending line and
        continue parsing the next option. Remove appendStr (to reduce memory
        allocations), simplify code. Improve linkage: move all yconfig.cc
        external code in class YConfig.
      POSIX-compliancy requires the use of __linux__, instead of linux. linux
        may not be defined even though __linux__ is. For instance with g++
        -std=c++98.
      +4 convenience methods.
      Stricter parsing of winoptions. One of two loadMenus made obsolete.
        Rewrote loadMenusProg.
      stricter parsing of whitespace in winoptions. Fix a delete[]. Fix a leak
        for icon. Simplify loadWinOptions.
      Use upath for configuration directories, prevents a leak and simplifies
        code (no manual memory management).
      A redesign with cleaner semantics and 3 subclasses for different release
        of dynamic memory.
      When parsing "env" for each line add all expansion results. Trim every
        "env" string. Permit "env" input lines where '=' is surrounded with
        spaces.
      test strlcpy with operlap of source/destination.
      +stat method.
      Simplify closeFiles and drastically reduce number of fcntl system calls on
        exec. If execlp fails then print a warning with exe + strerror.
      add 2 missing destructors.
      prefer setenv over putenv.
      Fix for focus on map: only compare fUserTime when it is unequal to -1,
        otherwise doActivate would always be set to false.
      Fix for focus on map: only compare fUserTime when it is unequal to -1,
        otherwise doActivate would always be set to false.
      merge wmframe.cc fix
      Add --display option to icewm-session.  Save errno in fail().
      bool configurationNeeded was never needed, now deleted.
      Improve error handling in loadMenusProg. Allow waitpid to fail because of
        a competing SIGCHILD handler.
      Don't assume execl /bin/sh can never fail in
        YWindowManager::execAfterFork.
      Fix int format string errors for calls to warn(...) for long arguments.
      Consistently use ACOUNT where appropriate.
      Restore support for const copy operations using an ownership flag.
        Improve efficiency by avoiding virtual tables. Prevent inadvertent
        exchange of pointers between different allocation mechanisms
        (free/delete/[]). Tested OK sofar.
      Consistently use ACOUNT where appropriate.
      print_preferences print_options
      Add 3 options to icewm: "  --configured        Print the compile time
        configuration.
" "  --directories       Print the configuration
        directories.
" "  --postpreferences   Print preferences after all
        processing.
"
      Silence annoying startup messages about using private configuration files.
      Update, small changes.
      If left hand side of upath.relative() is empty then return right hand side
        unmodified.
      Prefer static linkage.
      More accurate countThemes. Old version always subtracted 1, even if
        directory was non-existent or empty. New version verifies if de->d_name
        is a directory and if it has a readable "default.theme" file in it.
      correction: access == 0 means yes it exists.
      Support menuButton pixmaps in motif. This fixes
        https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/31
      udir.h provides a small but handy class for simplifying code which deals
        with directories, like themes.
      Simplify code for directories, like themes, with udir class.
      Merge.
      Correction: run "icewmtray" before "startup" script.
      Move help text into separate method getHelpText().
      Properly support searching for resources in XDG_CONFIG_HOME. First search
        in XDG_CONFIG_HOME, only then in other directories. Simplifications and
        optimizations to YResourcePaths. YPathElement could be removed as it is
        just a upath. When removing elements in a loop then count downwards to
        zero to avoid quadratic time.
      Support referring to a theme without the last component (basename
        "default.theme"). This requires less typing. Optimization to getArgument
        to prevents lots of memory allocations when parsing preferences.
      Fix for getExtension (wasn't used anywhere sofar).
      Support the usual icewm command line options in icewm-session and
        propagate their values to child programs when fork+execing. Also support
        them in icewmtray and icewmbg. The -t option to icewm didn't work
        properly because it used GetLongArgument instead of GetShortArgument:
        fixed. Don't scan preferences for a themeName when themeName has already
        been given on the command line. Allow to override preferences with some
        other config file. Cleanup of unused code in icewmbg.cc. Memory leak fix
        in themes.cc when 15+ themes are available and many submenus are created
        with a strdup which was never freed. Remove the --no-configure
        commandline option as it wasn't implemented.
      Update options.
      --list-themes       Print a list of all available themes.
      Remove superfluous #include statements.
      Print directories in the order IceWM searches in them.
      More man page new content.
      Add GCC __attribute__ for format string checks. Define it empty for
        non-gcc.
      Cleanup code a bit for icetray.cc.
      Remove superfluous #include statements.
      Prefer snprintf/strlcpy/strlcat over sprintf/strcpy/strcat in some cases.
      splitall may return true and an empty string. Detect this and continue.
      YIcon would test a large number of paths, some of which have no chance for
        success.  Reduce the number of such tests. Also reduce duplicate path
        tests. Fully support the .SVG image format when searching for icons.
      +SVG and icon sizes.
      Add remove and renameAs. Add defaults to access and mkdir.
      For --list-themes also allow short -l alias.
      Always set line buffering mode for stdout.
      Make sure all YIcon resources are freed on termination.
      Because we have only Focus and Themes it doesn't make sens to create a
        whole new Settings submenu in the toplevel menu. Instead of "Settings"
        just use entries for Focus + Themes.
      Move functions of wmconfig.cc into class WMConfig (except for addWork and
        setLook). Rewrite setDefault: properly support XDG config directory, use
        at most one hash comment sign per config line, be very careful about
        existence of directories and simplify file I/O code.
      Also report the name of the theme in warnings about gradients.
      ycmdline.[ch] is not used in gnome1 and gnome2: removed.
      Sort the entries in browsing menus alphabetically.
      Remove superfluous #include statements.
      Check if no config directory exists and could not be made.
      Class Argument supports efficient storage of configuration parsing.
      Use class Argument to efficiently store parsing results. This also prevent
        memory leaks in the context of parsing errors when character arrays were
        not deleted before return from parseMenus().
      Better support theme names which don't have a slash or a .theme
        extensions.
      getResourcePaths was called with a null argument instead of "workspace".
        This results in many more file lookups. Use "workspace" when calling
        getResourcePaths for a small speedup.
      Complete redesign which avoids virtual or refcounts, but supports
        inter-allocation type assingment (free/new/new[]).
      For every cursor pointer one new call to getResourcePaths would be done,
        which is inefficient. Only do it once or twice per startup for a small
        speedup.
      Make some methods static and private.
      update URLs.
      Add 4 new themes: CrystalBlue, Helix, NanoBlue, Natural. Don't use
        anymore: gtk2, nice, nice2, warp3, warp4, yellowmotif.
      Add collate to support locale sensitive comparison using strcoll. Fix an
        obscure bug in mstring::searchAndReplaceAll (unlikely to occur).
      Add support for sorted directory access (locale sensitive).
      Use adir to have browse menus sorted. Make file+folder icons not static
        but local.
      Make PRECONDITION usable in isolation by compile time define PRECON.
      Sort menu entries with collate (strcoll).
      Concentrate nearly all pixmap .xpm loading in one place. More controlled
        loading of pixmaps, would allow to extend it to PNG and SVG. Remove the
        CONFIG_LOOK_* preprocessor symbols as they were not usefully implemented
        and just cluttered. Streamline wmLook and make it print useful info in
        --postpreferences. Make stderr line buffered.
      Typo: fix missing 2 in taskbar2Pixres.
      Remove unused headers.
      Make all configure --enable/--disable options compile again.
      Make some tests compile.
      Document the "env" file.
      Add wpixres.cc to ICEWM_SRCS.
      Document the "focus_mode" file.
      Memory leak fix: don't call newstr on parameters passed to
        YStringArray::append, because that one already does a newstr on the
        received parameter.
      Fix issue #143: remove theme Natural.
      Improve man page documentation about "icewm-session".
      icehelp didn't accept standard IceWM options. If no help file was given
        then use the standard ICEHELPIDX location. This allows to start icehelp
        from the command line by just typing "icehelp".
      Manual page: add "icehelp" to the list of IceWM programs.
      Prevent 3 warnings when compiling with clang++.
      Document focus mode and the taskbar.
      Document the QuickSwitch window and all keyboard shortcuts.
      Fix option parsing for --theme/--config for icewmbg.
      Document window placement, window layers and workspaces.
      Document mouse bindings.
      Document applet details.
      man intro + semitransparency.
      Document icewm signals.
      Enforce 32-bit unsigned comparison of X11 time stamps in updateUserTime.
        This improves availability of focused windows in issue #37.
      Update bug report location to Github.
      Update ChangeLog for 1.4.0 release.
      Update NEWS for 1.4.0 release.
      Update README.md for 1.4.0 release.
      Add missing PACKAGE_BUGREPORT define. Change empty PACKAGE_URL into
        website URL.
      Changes to print_configured to make it compile under CMake.

Release icewm-1.3.10 released 2015-07-02
----------------------------------------

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 1.3.9...1.3.10

Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org> (68):
      Fix format buffer overflow (Debian bug 765965) and other issues
      Build fix with -Werror and without xrandr support
      Make linking with -lsupc++ effective (w/o stdlibc++)
      German translation update and review
      Basic review of Russian translation (incomplete)
      Language update, merge with some translations from Debian, manual review
        of some typical format string mismatches
      Replaced previous reimplementation of ACOUNT macro
      Unified setting of EXEEXT through Makefile variable only
      Fix the check of fribidi_log2vis' result (the code looks like it was
        intended that way, and clang barfs otherwise)
      this cannot be NULL unless more ugly (and better traceable) mess appears
      Avoid potential use of unitialized value
      Optional use of clang for development, work around unknown pragmas (might
        need a review later)
      Minor improvements after code check with clang++
      Moved yworker.{cc,h} out of the build, apparently not used anymore
      Found the "better traceable mess" expected in a previous commit. Added
        proper checks in callers of YPixmap::replicate(...).
      Stronger control of startup sequence in icewm-session, avoids weird
        effects (like zombie windows) caused by races around icewm vs. icewmtray
        vs. "startup" script execution
      Assign suspend-to-ram action through systemd (if active) which is more
        likely to be available on modern Linux desktops and makes more sense
        than killing running WM with the "Sleep" button
      If Linux and SystemD found, try to use that for default shutdown/reboot
        actions. WLAN interfaces are also more likely to exist nowadays than PPP
        links.
      Little C++14 related fixes
      clang was right, those members are not used and bring some risk of
        programming mistakes
      Experimental mod using signalfd (disabled by default)
      Ignore some IDE metadata
      Fix stupid crash of gnome menu when an invalid folder was specified
      Added alternative XDG menu generator
      Added submenu separation to fdomenu, no sorting yet
      Better recursion control
      Sorting submenues by translateable names
      l10n update for fdomenu
      Memory leak fighting, more menu categories (wine, editors)
      Fixed automatic inclusion into build sequence
      Use a callback to us and glib launch functionality for complicated
        commands and terminal requirement
      Bring in more structure, use GTree to sort and remove dupes
      Make icewm-menu-fdo the default FDO menu generator
      Make the name of the terminal program customizable via compiler options
      Try to use internal launching of commands unless they are too complex
      Added (restored?) hot keys on OK/Cancel confirmation dialog, adapted
        translation as far as I could understand them
      Fixed the gettext extraction of new submenu titles, fixed build without
        i18n
      Make CPU info tooltip better understandable
      Add workarounds for older glib versions
      Pass 0 not NULL as signalfd flags
      Little modifications to make the code compilable with weird option
        settings like no taskbar and not lite
      icehelpcc: Fix const correctness on char pointers
      ifdef instead of if on CONFIG_APPLET_CPU_STATUS
      globit.c: fix some implicite old style C casting
      globit.c makes use of GNUisms (asprintf, glob_pattern_p), make that code
        conditional and fix unsafe code
      Experimental cmake build system
      Added some user instructions for cmake build system
      Make build/install of icesound/icehelp conditional (not for LITE), minor
        compiler warning fixes
      Restore XINERAMA support with Cmake build system
      [cmake] Build translations for the default target, not icewm
      Remove the broken locale switching when retrieving fallback font
      Move the HTML generation to the global target dependency
      [cmake] Fix ENABLE_NLS setting
      [cmake] fix of some installation target locations
      [cmake] Added forgoten icesh, made po files optional
      [cmake] Fixed sound subsystem selection
      [cmake] Cosmetic fixes
      [cmake] Incorporated new memory monitor enabling
      [cmake] consistent naming of gmo targets
      Updated de.po for strings of the new memory display
      More cmake usage information for integrators
      Also react to the sleep key found on Compaq keyboards
      Fix build failure with GCC <= 4.7
      Smarter detection of systems with battery (auto-enable APM applet on
        laptops)
      Save some CPU cycles while reading procfs (jump to begin instead of
        reopening)
      Added forgotten CONFIG_SHAPED_DECORATIONS option to cmake BS
      Experimental feature: add custom environment variables from an extra file
      Increase interface name lenght limit on Linux
